# Phase 1 Project

## Project Overview
Recognising the dynamic shift in the entertainment industry, where big organisations have made tremendous progress in the creation of unique video content, Microsoft is starting a brand-new fascinating endeavour. Microsoft has made the decision to enter the film production industry strategically, leveraging its impressive technological prowess and resources. This choice demonstrates the firm's dedication to diversifying its holdings and keeping up with shifting consumer tastes. Despite being a major player in technology, Microsoft recognises the value of gaining expertise and experience in the film industry. Microsoft wants to get a thorough understanding of the current trends and audience preferences that influence box office success in order to assure a successful entry. Microsoft is positioned to have a huge impact on the world because to its commitment to informed decision-making and enthusiasm for innovation.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data
I have used data from the following movie datasets in the the 'zipped Data':

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)
