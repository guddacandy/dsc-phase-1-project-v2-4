# Phase 1 Project

## Project Overview
Recognising the dynamic shift in the entertainment industry, where big organisations have made tremendous progress in the creation of unique video content, Microsoft is starting a brand-new fascinating endeavour. Microsoft has made the decision to enter the film production industry strategically, leveraging its impressive technological prowess and resources. This choice demonstrates the firm's dedication to diversifying its holdings and keeping up with shifting consumer tastes. Despite being a major player in technology, Microsoft recognises the value of gaining expertise and experience in the film industry. Microsoft wants to get a thorough understanding of the current trends and audience preferences that influence box office success in order to assure a successful entry. Microsoft is positioned to have a huge impact on the world because to its commitment to informed decision-making and enthusiasm for innovation.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### Business Understanding

#### Key stakeholders include:

1. Microsoft's Head of the New Movie Studio
2. Microsoft's Executive Leadership Team

#### Key Business Questions:

 i.	Most popular/produced genre?
ii.Which languages are movies mostly produced in?
iii.What is the gross income of movies over the years?
v.	What is the best runtime for movies?

### Data Understanding and Analysis

#### Source of Data:
I gathered data from different sources, including Box Office Mojo, IMDb The datasets contains information on recent movies, including genres, runtime minutes, foreign and domestic gross,audience ratings etc.

### Description of Data:
The dataset consists of thousands of movies released in recent years and includes attributes such as:

i. Title

### Visualizations

#### Identify the most popular genres in terms of the number of movies released.
From the dataset I was able to plot a bar graph to show the distribution of movie genres as follows:

### Conclusion

To enter the film industry successfully, Microsoft's new movie studio should create a diverse portfolio of films within the recomended genres, carefully manage budgets, and prioritize audience satisfaction. Additionally, building strong relationships with industry professionals and leveraging Microsoft's existing resources and technologies can enhance their competitive edge.
